I am currently a Phd candidate at [School of Mathematical Science](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/Default/index) and [the Institute of Natural Sciences](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), where I was advised by [Prof. Zhenli Xu](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/xuzl/). I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from Zhiyuan College (Zhiyuan Honors Program, Recommended Students via Math Competitions).

Research Interests
======
My current research interests include computational mathematics and computational physics, including fast algorithm for electrostatic problem, kernel-independent functional approximation, numerical solution of PDE, high performance computing, and machine learning.
